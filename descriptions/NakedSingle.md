# Naked Single

A Naked Single is an empty cell that only has 1 option left for it, which makes it the most basic and fundamental way to fill a cell.

A cell will be reduced to 1 option by methodically eliminating all other options either through the basic rules of Sudoku or via other methods.

It is easiest to see a Naked Single when all candidates for all cells are placed and constantly updated, which can be done through auto-candidate mode.
