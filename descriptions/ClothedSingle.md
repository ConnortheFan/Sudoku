# Clothed Single

A Clothed Single (termed by myself) is similar to a Naked Single where a cell can be filled with a digit, but is found through scanning the rows, columns, and boxes rather than each individual cell.

The easiest way to spot a Clothed Single is by looking at a single digit at a time. When in a box, row, or column where that digit only has 1 cell to go to, that is a Clothed Single and you can fill that cell.

A Clothed Single can be reduced to a Naked Single by removing all other candidates in the cell (the clothes) via a Tuplet of all other cells in the row/column/box. For the sake of human understanding, a Clothed Single can be filled without reducing it down to a Naked Single.
